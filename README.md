## About üîé

Minerva is a package to aid in the building, fitting and testing of neural network models on geo-spatial
rasterised land cover data.

## Getting Started ‚ñ∂

If one wishes to use [torchgeo](https://pypi.org/project/torchgeo/), installation on Linux is recommended to handle the
compilation of the required C-based libraries.

### Installation ‚¨á

`minerva` is currently not included in any distribution. The recommended install is therefore to install the latest pre-release version from `GitHub`.

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Pale-Blue-Dot-97/Minerva.git
```

You will be required to provide your `GitHub` credentials that have valid access to `minerva`.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Requirements üìå

`minerva` now supports the use of [torchgeo](https://torchgeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
datasets with upcoming support for [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) datasets.

Required Python modules for `minerva` are stated in `requirements.txt`.

`minerva` currently only supports `python` 3.8 -- 3.10.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Usage üñ•

The core functionality of `minerva` provides the modules to define `models` to fit and test, `loaders` to pre-process,
load and parse data, and a `Trainer` to handle all aspects of a model fitting. Below is a MWE of creating datasets,
initialising a Trainer and model, and fitting and testing that model then outputting the results:

### MWE Driver Script üìÑ

```python
from minerva.utils import CONFIG  # Module containing various utility functions.
from minerva.trainer import Trainer  # Class designed to handle fitting of model.


# Initialise a Trainer. Also creates the model.
trainer = Trainer(**CONFIG)

# Run the fitting (train and validation epochs).
trainer.fit()

# Run the testing epoch and output results.
trainer.test()
```

See `scripts\MinervaExp.py` as an example script implementing `minerva`.

### Config Structure ‚öô

See `inbuilt_cfgs\example_config.yml` as an example config file.

### Creating a Manifest for your Dataset üìë

Use `scripts\ManifestMake.py` to construct a manifest to act as a look-up table for a dataset.
